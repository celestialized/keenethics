        Minimum Viable Product: Between an Idea and the Product
      </h1>
      <p style={{ fontStyle: 'italic' }}>
        A product with just enough features to gather comprehensive qualitative
        feedback
      </p>
      <p>
        Every customer wants to be heard and understood. The software world
        offers an excessive number of apps and websites, but only some of them
        receive users’ attention and love. To find out whether your idea can
        find a place in this competitive environment, create a minimum viable
        product first or partner up with an agency that can provide you with MVP
        development services.
      </p>

        <h2>What Is MVP?</h2>
        <p>
          The minimum viable product is a perfect opportunity to let potential
          users voice their attitude and to test out a product before its final
          launch. Gathering and analyzing qualitative feedback is a primary task
          of an MVP development company. Based on such findings, the business
          modifies its product idea to meet the customer’s expectations. After
          that, another MVP is created and tested, the customer research
          findings are updated, and the project is adjusted accordingly. This
          process turns into a cycle of MVP product development and takes place
          over and over again until the ultimate customer satisfaction is
          reached.

        <h2>How MVP Software Development Is Conducted?</h2>
        <p>
          Each and every product is different, and so is the process of its
          development. Before we jump into details as for how MVP software
          development is carried out, we want to point out that it is an
          individual and iterative process.
        </p>
        <p>
          At first, you have an idea. Even if you feel that it is revolutionary
          and genius, in fact, it still may be rather vague.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our task as of an MVP development company is to help you put this idea
          into practice. We start with conducting research: we study the needs,
          interests, and demographic characteristics of the target audience, we
          analyze the strengths and weaknesses of competitors, we check out all
          the features we may implement and select the best ones of them. The
          information is organized and presented with the help of graphs,
          charts, tables, or any other visuals we agree on.
        </p>
        <p>Now, your idea seems clearer, but it still not presentable.</p>
        <p>
          We create a Proof of Concept. Basically, it is aimed at summarizing
          the discovery stage and verifying that a theoretical idea can be put
          into practice.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ok, you know that your idea is feasible and comprehensive. You know
          that it can be done, but how?
        </p>
        <p>
          We need to understand what the user wants to see once they open the
          application, which actions they are most likely to take, or how they
          think. For this purpose, we map a user journey – a visual
          representation of a hypothetical user and their experience with the
          app from the minute they realize the need in a certain service,
          through the moment they first find and click through your app, and up
          until they make a decision whether to make this service a part of
          their lifestyle.
        </p>
        <p>
          After that, we develop a prototype, which is a simplified version of
          the product. It is interactive and working, it demonstrates the final
          product design and navigation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here, you have your idea implemented. Kind of. It can be shown to all
          the stakeholders but not to the client as long as it is just a rough
          draft.
        </p>
        <p>
          We make ultimate decisions about UI/UX and finalize the visual design,
          after which we start coding the minimum viable product.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your idea is illustrated, put in the code, and partially implemented –
          ready to meet its first user.
        </p>
        <p>
          We finish the process of MVP software development, launch the MVP,
          gather customers’ feedback, and analyze the results, according to
          which the MVP is modified.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you see that your customers are fully satisfied, you are willing
          to start implementing the final product.

        <h3>MVP Product Development Cycle</h3>

          alt="MVP Product Development Cycle"
        />
        <h3>For Example?</h3>
        <p>
          Let’s imagine, you want to create a bicycle. A cool, sturdy, and
          eco-friendly bicycle.
        </p>
        <p>
          What if the potential clients do not like it and your effort goes in
          vain? Or what if you are on a shoestring budget and you need to
          persuade investors first?
        </p>
        <p>
          You conduct a discovery stage: what a bike is, what parts it consists
          of, what bikes people like, and what riders complain about. After
          that, you answer the most important question: what you can do to make
          your bicycle stand out among the others.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let’s say, you found out how to create a bicycle chain that never
          falls out the chainring. Once you have a clear idea, you create your
          mechanism: a chain, with a chainring and pedals – your proof of
          concept. You show it to your investors, tell them more about your
          idea, and receive their approval and support to keep going with the
          project.
        </p>
        <img
          src="/static/approach/m-v-p/mvp-2.jpg"
          alt="MVP Product Development Cycle"
        />
        <p>
          Yet, it is not the time for the final bicycle as you have not seen it
          yet in actual size. You create a full-scale copy of the bicycle,
          carefully choose all the colors and materials, make it resemble a real
          product. However, the pedals won’t spin yet, and the steering wheel
          won’t turn. This is your prototype – looks pretty impressive but does
          not work yet.
        </p>
        <img
          src="/static/approach/m-v-p/mvp-3.jpg"
          alt="MVP Product Development Cycle"
        />
        <p>
          Your investors again review the idea and approve your design, but now
          they need to see the functionality. You again create a full-scale
          bicycle, but now, it has a working wheel, pedals, breaks, gears, and a
          sit. That is going to be your MVP. At this point, you can actually let
          your users try it out. They get on a bike, test it, and share their
          opinion with you. The more people tried it, the more comprehensive
          feedback you have. However, be sure not to show your bicycle to the
          people you do not trust or they leak your idea to a next-door guy who
          also makes bikes for a living.
        </p>
        <img
          src="/static/approach/m-v-p/mvp-4.jpg"
          alt="MVP Product Development Cycle"
        />
        <p>
          Subsequently, you modify your product in accordance with what your
          customers had to say until you are sure that you get it.
        </p>
        <p>
          And only after all these steps, when you have received financial
          support from your investors and approval of your customers, you are
          ready to launch manufacturing. You change a wooden seat with a
          cushioned one, install safety lights on your bicycle, lubricate the
          bicycle chain, put stickers and a bell, develop a marketing campaign,
          and start selling your product.

        <h2>Why Is MVP Important?</h2>
        <p>
          The MVP framework can and should be used within industries of all
          sorts. While for the manufacturers of traditional goods, it is a long
          and strenuous process, for the software developers, it is rather
          simple and accessible. Therefore, if the decision of any other
          business to disregard the minimum viable product development when
          creating something innovative is somehow understandable and can be
          justified, for a software development company, it is unforgivable.
          Eventually, if one decides to run a risk and implement the idea before
          checking up with the target audience, they put money, time, effort,
          energy, inspiration, and supporters on the line.
