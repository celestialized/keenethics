          <h2>What Is Web Development?</h2>
          <p>The Internet has turned into a universal environment where people communicate, rest, and work. Each web platform is a particular ecosystem with its own population, opportunities, and threats. However, hiring a professional and skillful team of web developers is the best way to ensure that the users of your website are safe and satisfied with their web experience. Some say that web development is going obsolete as mobile devices conquer the world. However, there are some strengths that make web development a decent competitor to mobile tech.</p>
