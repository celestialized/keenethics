        Every E-Commerce project needs to be integrated with a Payment Processing System. We
        suggest choosing only trusted and world-known systems like PayPal Payment Processing
        System. PayPal makes it simple to get paid securely anywhere you do business: online, on
        mobile, in person or via an invoice. You can create a personal or business PayPal
        account.
      </p>
      <p>
        PayPal Integration offers a few ways on how to accept payments:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>On your website or app;</li>
        <li>In person or in your store;</li>
        <li>By email or phone.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        What is great about the PayPal Payment System, you can easily integrate with Braintree
        for next-generation commerce solutions. On our KeenEthics spaceship, astronauts can
        provide any integration you need.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to the Nielsenâ€™s Online Buyer Insights, businesses that use PayPal API
        Integration can sell more. Up to 5.3% incremental new buyers, up to 44% higher checkout
        conversion with PayPal and up to 83% of PayPal shoppers are new to the business. In the
        list of PayPal partners you will find WooCommerce, Magento, Shopify, BigCommerce, and

      <h3>Hire PayPal Developers</h3>
      <p>
        For many companies, software development services are budget-burners. To cut the
        software development costs many businesses hire offshore providers and outsource the
        part of the project or the entire project. In web app development, front-end
        development, back-end development, Stripe, Braintree, PayPal Integration services are
        the major parts businesses choose to outsource. The main difficulty is to find a
        reliable partner that has related experience and resources and can deliver a high-end
        product you need.
