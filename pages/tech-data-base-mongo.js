        <h2>What Is MongoDB Development?</h2>
        <p>
          MongoDB is a document-based, distributed, dynamic, and scalable
          database, which is built to suit the latest development needs.
          Initially released in 2009, MongoDB is now at its fourth
          version, and the updates are released on a regular basis.
          The greatest advantages of this database are its flexibility,
          scalability, and convenience.
        </p>
        <p>
          SQL databases are table-based. Here, the data is stored in rows
          and columns typical of a traditional relational database. MongoDB
          is NoSQL and, respectively, document-based.
          A document-based database like MongoDB stores data in JSON objects,
          which enables MongoDB developers to create flexible
          and effective schemas.

            The founder of Banker Advisor constantly asked himself a
            question, why there is no such a comparative service
            for the investment and banking industry? The platform we
            have developed changes the game. It gives you a full
            picture of a certain bank or investment management agency
            through trusted peer reviews. MongoDB development services
            were particularly important here as the platform
            utilizes cloud technology.
