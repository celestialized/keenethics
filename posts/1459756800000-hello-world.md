   <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
   <p style="margin: 0">Let me introduce Keenethics.</p>
   <p>We are a team of web and mobile developers located in Lviv, Ukraine (GMT+2). We do a great job on a number of projects and participate in the life of the JavaScript community.</p>
   <p>There are a lot of software development companies of a different size and rates out there. They offer various perks and competitive salaries for developers. They have experiences, portfolios, and good reviews from the clients. So, why did we decide to create another one?</p>
   <p style="margin: 0">After analyzing several successful companies from the inside, we have noticed some inefficiencies. In a lot of cases, we found a room for improvement in their attitude towards a customer. We believe that there are plenty of advancements we can bring to the industry to make software development more agile, efficient, and closer to the customerâ€™s expectations.</p>
   <p>We strive to make remote web development more Keen and Ethical.</p>
   <p>We are going to share our thoughts and experiences in this blog. See you soon! :)</p>
   <p style="margin: 0">Sincerely Yours,</p>
   <p>Oleksiy Pletnov, CTO.</p>
