<h1 style="text-align: center;">Web Development 101: </br> General principles</h1>

Nowadays, software developer is a mainstream occupation in some countries. For example, in Ukraine it means you would be paid more than average, because of constant deficit of developers in the rapidly-growing industry. As a result, there are always lot of people who want to become software developers, but they don’t have industry-specific education.

So what do they do? They do a self-education course or a specific one with coaches and trainers. Anyway they have to be extremely lucky to get on board of some software company and start their carrier as trainees.

In the article below we would like to share our experience within few advices for people who decided to start their carrier as web-developers.

## Communication

You may have thought that usually developers only sit and code. The myth will be debunked! Before it gets to actual coding, each software is just an idea in somebody’s mind. If you start coding without getting this idea, there are chances you will build something different from what is needed. 

The first thing each developer should learn is quick and accurate understanding of the job. So be ready to:

- communicate with the client in English;
- ask proper questions if you do not understand anything;
- use a task-tracking system, such as Trello, TeamworkPM, or Jira;
- share understanding you got with others either informally or through documentation.

Communication is an art. Sometimes, it is even more important than actual coding. We would recommend you to check your level of English and practice communication as a first step.

## Algorithmic Thinking

Apparently, the only understanding of a task is not enough to complete it. Once the task is clear, a developer should prepare algorithms to implement what is needed. This is when the idea is converted into a program. It might be pretty easy sometimes, but usually, it may be time-consuming and require making complex diagrams.

Algorithmic thinking is a skill that can be trained. Try to imagine all the flows of a program before you actually start coding. The more you practice, the quicker and more accurate image you will get. It will give you a chance to foresee its development and avoid mistakes. You can also check services like CodeFights to train the ability to solve programming tasks, but it would require knowledge of a programming language.

## Programming

Finally, that is the part where you start actual coding. First of all, try to get some general understanding of the client-server model, HTTP, caching, DNS, and other concepts commonly used in web development. We would recommend you to start with some article on Wikipedia and follow links on subjects you feel you should get familiar with. Web is based on JavaScript (or any other programming language), HTML, and CSS, and you definitely need to understand what they are for and be able to use them. You can start with Codecademy courses. In most cases, you will use some frameworks or libraries for the development, so you need to study them as well. We would definitely recommend you to study React and Meteor as the most promising frameworks that we use almost for every single project. To store your data, you would need to use a database. Knowing how to work with MongoDB and SQL-databases is also must-have for backend or full-stack web-developer. You would also need to know Git as a safe method for collaborative work with sources. Study how to run basic operations, how to merge conflicts and get familiar with Gitflow. If you don’t have experience with Linux , consider transitioning to it as your main OS. Most web-servers run it, and most of the tools would work best with it.

## Attitude

Another thing crucial for collaboration is a correct attitude. No matter how great you are as a developer. If you are not reliable enough, you may cause significant issues for anyone who works with you. Of course, everyone wants to think of himself as of a reliable and highly-motivated person, but try to think critically  —  maybe there is something to work on.

## How to Make Recruiters Want to Hunt You?

First of all, prepare a great resume. Who told you a resume should be brief and reveal only your experience and skills? Have you ever thought how recruiters choose someone from a list of resumes with the same sets of skills? 

At Keenethics we highly appreciate essay-like resumes that not only tell us about your skills and experiences but also your greatest targets, hobbies, and passions. We want to hear your story.

## Schedule

How long will it take to become a web developer?

- Depending on your level of English, you may need some time to improve it. Let’s assume that you are able to read articles in English after a 2-month intensive training. Attending lessons 3 times a week and watching films or TV-series exclusively in English may get you into better shape.
- Spending about 30 minutes a day reading about general programming and web concepts for about 2 months will give you an overall image of different technologies and relations between them. If you add another 15 minutes reading the latest news about web-development you may also get some understanding of current trends.
- Spending another 60-90 minutes a day for 2-3 months on studying actual programming, you may also get knowledge required for initial onboarding. For example, you will be able to complete HTML/CSS, jQuery, JavaScript, and Git courses at Codecademy in one month. Also, you can spend another month completing React and Meteor tutorials.
- If you do not use Linux yet, we would highly recommend you to switch to Ubuntu. It may take you about 2 hours to set it up, and you will have to spend another 30–60 minutes a day during the first two weeks studying how to use it.
- You would need to spend an hour or two writing your essay-like resume.

This way, I believe that anyone who likes algorithms, is comfortable with computers, was not bad at math at school, and has intermediate English level, can get prepared for becoming a trainee in software development in 2-3 months. Is it too long or you are ready to take up the challenge?
