  <p>Delegation is a common problem. And not only for professional managers but also for other people when dealing with larger projects. It's so obvious to delegate something you aren't competent in, or part of the large task, you can't complete on your own. And still many managers end delegating only small trivial tasks. Some business-owners even study programming-languages in order to build apps they require. Why? Because...</p>

## You never know whether you were understood correct

You can't open someone's had to check it.

A good check might be to ask what someone will do to achieve the goal. The answer might show the wrong path.

But what if you don't know the path? What if you need an app and you don't know how they get built. You need to keep control on the result. And here requirements management steps in.

At Keenethics we try to make sure we are on the same page with our clients by visualizing end result, describing it and confirming. We even go further and validate whether an end result is actually useful for the client - he could want a wrong decision for his need.

## You still need to control

Even if you were understood correct, usually understanding isn't complete. And the longer someone stays on his own the higher might be difference from what you expect.

In software development it's useful to have daily standup-meetings and demos just for that. This way you might see something goes wrong direction and fix that at once.

But if you leave things on their own and can't find to keep an eye on them, things might blow out.

## Don't do

Because of first 2 issues some end up doing things on their own. They believe that's faster than explaining things to someone and than to control them.

That might be true in some cases. But this model doesn't scale. And you might end with technical tasks taking all your time making it impossible to work on what matters more - on strategy.


P.S. I have to thing on how to delegate writing articles to the blog. :)
