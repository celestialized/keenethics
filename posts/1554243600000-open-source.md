</div>

Many developers are fond of [open-source](/about-open-source). And that's for a reason: they use it every day to speed up their work.
There are many successful examples of open software starting with Linux and ending with React. It's often well-crafted and it's often a pleasure to work with that kind of high-quality code. And it's honorable to be a contributor of some widely-used open-source project.

At Keenethics we support a widely-used [Botpress](https://github.com/botpress/botpress) open-source chatbots framework.
And open-source model has it's pros and cons.

## Open-source sweets

When running an open-source project you are getting a few nice things like great github-profile and easy participation in things like [Hacktober-fest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) (which we [run in Lviv](https://www.facebook.com/events/2180407068873890/) by the way) - basically you don't need to do anything to pass the challenge, you already contributed to open-source.

You might also get discounts or event free or charge infrastructure to run your project. Not only this saves you money but forces you to use all the greatest tools in your development.

And that's basically it.

## Higher code-quality

It's often stated that open-source code is of a higher quality. But the fact that you open-sourced something doesn't increase it's quality automatically as you might guess. You get the quality of code that you basically write. And yes, you might get reviews from the community or even contributions and refactoring, but you might also get contributions of the lower-quality.

## Collaborators improve your product

That's what you'd expect, but that's not what always happens. What you can expect for sure is requests to improve your product or to help with something (given the product is popular). And you might deal with different kinds of people. Some of them may expect you to react to their requests as if you are in a 24/7 support. They might vote for feature and ping you during the weekend asking when something will be ready.

Still some might open PR's improving your product. But you have to take care of explaining rules on how things should be prepared and the way they get merged into mainline. Otherwise you might again end up refactoring someone's code and leaving people disappointed by not merging their changes.

## Don't harm

Participate in open-source! That makes you grow faster as a developer and that brings useful result to the whole community.
At least try not to harm community that gives you all these great open-source things. Contribute wisely and help contributors deal with the community by answering questions you can help with.
