When choosing a person for a job we are usually interested in his/her experience doing relevant things.
We check CVs for that and make sure a person is educated and trained for the job. And that usually works.

## Traditions

Traditional education often gives a sense that graduating from college or university makes you know everything.
But the more you know the more questions you get.

Historically before XIX'th century traditions ruled. So if you wanted to build a ship, you would hire someone knowing traditions of building ships. This guaranteed that you would get a working result in the end.

You could try breaking traditions. But you might end up in situation like [Vasa warship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasa_(ship)).

## Scientific approach

But developing traditions is a very slow process that requires lots of resources to be spent and spoiled before traditions gets there.

So opposite to it you might try to use knowledge of Physical laws, calculus and experiments to build something which didn't get into tradition. This is where things started to speed up rapidly. And this is were number of non-trivial tasks started to grow.

But even with that many industries get their short-term traditions that exist for decades while some technologies are in use. E.g. steam trains.

## So you've got a task

That's all fine, but what do you do with these non-trivial tasks in the end?

1. First thing you need is correct mood and attitude. If you aren't calm and can't concentrate - it's difficult to produce a decision
2. Write down the task and if possible try to visualize it
3. Try to understand what exactly makes this task non-trivial? Which questions would you like to have answers on?
4. Search for information available to answer your questions

Isn't this trivial? It looks so, but it actually works.
