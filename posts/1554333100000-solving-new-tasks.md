When choosing a person for a certain job, we are interested in how relevant the experience they have is. We check CVs and make sure that the person is well-educated and properly trained for the job. Usually, this approach has to work. However, what if I tell you that, besides the traditional approach, there is a scientific one, which might work better for you?

## Traditional Approach

Traditional education often gives a feeling that graduating from college or university makes you know everything. Yet, the more you know, the more questions you get.

Historically, traditions ruled. If you lived before the XIX century and wanted to build a ship, you would hire someone, who built ships for years and had learned this from their father, who had learned this from their grandfather, etc. This would guarantee that you would get a working result in the end, but at the same time, if you asked them why they built a ship in one way and not in another – you would not get an explanation.

    Surely, you could try breaking traditions, but you would likely end up in trouble, like in the notorious case with <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasa_(ship)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Vasa warship</a>.

Yet, developing traditions is a very slow process, which requires lots of resources to be spent and wasted before the result gets there.

## Scientific Approach

On the contrary, you may try to use knowledge of physical laws, calculus, and experiments to build something not traditional but innovative. This is where things started to speed up and the number of non-trivial tasks started to grow.

But even so, most industries develop some minor short-term traditions, which exist for decades only while some technologies are in use. 

All good, but the question “what do you do with these non-trivial tasks” may come across as confusing.

## So What to Do Once You Have Got a Task?

The first thing you need is a proper mood and attitude. If you are not calm and cannot concentrate – it is difficult to find a solution. Then, write down the task and try to visualize it or to break it into minor sub-objectives. You need to understand what exactly makes this task non-trivial, which questions you would like to have answers for. After that, you look for information available to answer your questions.
Isn't this trivial? It looks so, but it actually works.
