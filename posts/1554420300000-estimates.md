Supermarkets usually have fixed prices for everything they have in stock. Banks have fixed commissions. Services like haircut or training also have a price that you know beforehand. And that works perfectly fine.

So when you start a software project you would also expect to have it's price beforehand. You might need that to compare prices of different vendors and to know which budget you need to cover. So you go to a software vendor and ask something like "How much would it cost to build a website?".

## No simple answer

An interesting here is that usually you won't get an answer immediately.
And there's a good reason for that: there are not that many identical websites over the internet.
Under the same "website" task you might have very different things on your mind. And sadly a note that "it's an eshop" won't help much here.

At Keenethics for the time beeing we never had 2 identical projects. Yes, for sure they have something in common. E.g. login feature you would need for most of the web-applications. But even login flow might have quite a lot of differences:

- do you need social login? which social networks should be supported?
- do you need password recovery?
- do you need registration?
- ...

And here's a tip: if you are getting a simple answer with the price at this point you definitely want to know what you'll get in the end for that money.

## Hard way

So usually conscious software vendors would try to figure out your requirements:

- you'll have to answer multiple questions starting with business-idea and finishing with login-details
- UX-expert might try to prepare mockups of an end product
- high-level info on your project gets documented
- it gets than detalized and decomposed into actual tasks
- engineers estimate tasks
- based on that actual price gets calculated

This takes time. For larger project it might take months to finalize and document all the requirements. And this increases an end price of the project.

But following this way in most cases still won't give you accurate estimate: usually most tasks are uncommon and thus estimate is a combination of previous experience and intuition. Deviations produce risks. And risks also make their way into price.

## T&M

"Time and material" approach is an easy and flexible alternative to this process which requires trustworthy relationships though. This way only rough estimates get provided but:
- development might start much faster
- you get highest flexibility to change requirements as you go
- an end price might be lower
