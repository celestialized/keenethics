What does it mean to develop an application? Usually this means producing a pice of software that meets requirements by implementing certain features. And how do we do that? We take requirements, [estimate](/blog/1554420300000-estimates) them and develop features one by one. Right?

Almost.

## Bugs

Yes, they do occur. Depending on the development process, complexity of the software itself, technical stack and many other parameters number of bugs varies.

At Keenethics we usually follow several best-practices to minimize their level, e.g.:

- we teach our developers to write code in defensive style
- developers prepare automated tests
- manual QA helps testing non-trivial cases

In some cases we consciously harden this process to meet higher requirements of a real business that can't accept critical issues in production. Sometimes we loose it to speed up development (e.g. for prototyping). But anyways QA theory claims it's usually impossible to test app 100% and cover all possible scenarious.

So this directly affects the process and team needs to test things and fix issues that occur.

This doesn't make any customer happy but at least this is something that everyone understands and that can be prioritized.

## Technical debt

But there's other side that is less obvious. The longer you develop something the more technical debt you are getting.

So what's "technical debt"? It's a methafor meaning all the quality-related issues you have in the code that would lead to spending additional resources in the future.

Technical debt occurs due to variety of reasons:

- business pushing to release new features faster
- lack of tests
- rapidly changing requirements
- inexperienced developers
- etc.

## Refactoring

Usually you need to spend time refactoring existing code to solve code-quality issues. And thus lower technical debt.

But what's refactoring? It's the process of restructuring existing code without changing it's external behavior.

And that's actually something that might be difficult to understand for business people managing the project. Will we get any new features? - No. Will we at least fix some bugs? Also no. What will we get then?

Working with technical debt helps avoiding bugs and keeping development at a good pace.

Sometimes business indeed might not need that: e.g. if that's a prototype, [POC](/services-proof) or there are business priorities that can't be switched. But usually cutting off refactoring wouldn't be a wise thing to do.

On the other hand you might spend really huge amount of time on refactoring depending on the level of developer's perfectionism which also doesn't make sense. So just leaving time for vague "refactoring" also isn't something that project needs.

So you need to have a balance. *You shouldn't spend more time on refactoring than you will save in the future*. Which sounds logical but again faces [estimation difficulties](/blog/1554420300000-estimates).

Ideal refactoring is refactoring that doesn't actually occur. And at Keenethics we train our developers to think forward and write better code. We do codereviews not only within one team but also between the teams.

And don't forget to document technical debt. If you don't even leave TODO's in the code most likely you'll forget about issue. And than event if you have time for it you won't recall that.
