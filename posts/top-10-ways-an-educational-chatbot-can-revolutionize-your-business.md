Chatbots are the optimal way to personalize your website or platform for the best needs and interests of your users. Using the advancements in AI and machine learning, they communicate with your customers and offer them exactly the answers or services that they need.

The chatbot is an interactive computer program, which is designed specifically to converse via textual or auditory means.

All the industries witnessed the rise of chatbot technology and the benefits that it brings. Meanwhile, education must be the business domain that is the slowest to implement innovations, and yet, those could considerably improve the performance and productivity of students and educators.

Here, these are the essential benefits that a chatbot for education may provide your app users with.

## #1. Learning languages

<p>
  All language learners remember the rule that “practice makes perfect”. However, what if one does not have an opportunity to travel abroad and communicate with foreigners or to hire a personal tutor? In this case, one would be delighted to talk to a chatbot, which would let the user practice their speaking, listening, reading, and writing skills. Business chatbots have been already implemented, for example, by Duolingo, Memrise, Babbel, and <a href="/project-comic-english" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ComicEnglish</a>.
</p>

## #2. Accessing educational materials anytime

A chatbot for education can be developed to find reference books or articles for your users based on the requirements or keywords that they enter. In other words, the chatbot would perfectly serve as one’s personal library assistant. Also, the chatbot can be used as an online dictionary or translator, which would provide your user with an immediate and convenient, 24/7 assistance.

## #3. Receiving learning feedback

Traditionally, a teacher would have to check tens and hundreds of similar test works to score them. In this case, students would be waiting to see their marks for days. However, the higher education chatbot technology enables users to receive the score with a brief comment right after the test is completed. Artificial intelligence can easily count the number of correct answers to put a mark, and according to which answer was incorrect, provide a short recommendation for the learner.

## #4. Tracking learning progress

Accessing learning records may be troublesome, especially if one does not know where to look for. A student, a parent, or a teacher may ask the chatbot about any mark at any subject from any point in time and get it in a matter of seconds. It is equally helpful for the self-learning app users, who want to track their progress. They may also ask the chatbot to conduct a quick assessment of their knowledge and skills.

## #5. Managing time, tasks, meetings, and ideas

A higher education chatbot can be designed as a highly personalized voice assistant, who would help your users keep track of their time, remind of pending tasks or meetings, and note down their ideas. This assistant will function only within your app so that it does not interfere with other reminders or notes. In addition, the chatbot for business will let you optimize the user data collection process, as will be described in the following section of this article.

What are the benefits that such a software solution would provide you as a business owner with?

## #1. Being available 24/7

What if your target audience comprises people from all over the world? Are you ready to reply to your customer in the middle of the night, or would you be willing to delegate this job to a program? Artificial intelligence and chatbots can do all the work for you. Regardless of whether it is the middle of the night or the busiest hour of the day, each of your users will get an immediate reply and assistance with their request.

## #2. Collecting user data

By collecting and analyzing information about your users, you can optimize your marketing and advertising strategies so that they resonate with your target audience. More than that, all this information will be willingly provided by your users to the business chatbot, so you will not face any data privacy issues. More than that, the process of data collection will be fully automated.

## #3. Automating customer support

The users of your particular product usually come to you with a few similar questions and requests. Let’s say, if you own a self-learning platform, users would ask about the availability of courses, their duration, cost, conditions, requirements, or certificates. Instead of answering the same question over and over again, employ chatbot features that will do this for you. Automating the customer support process with an interactive agent will save you a great deal of time and effort. Meanwhile, if a customer asks a question that does not belong to the set of typical ones, train your chatbot to redirect such requests to you.

## #4. Saving time, costs, and effort

If you hire people to communicate with your customers, you pay them a salary, which might require a significant share of your budget to be spent. If you choose to communicate with your customers yourself, be prepared to spend all your time and effort, especially as your app or website will grow more popular. If you develop a chatbot for higher education, you will have to pay only once – for the development itself. Since you have already built your own custom educational app, integrating a business chatbot as an additional feature would require a minimum of your time and money, but it will save a great deal of those in the future.

## #5. Keeping up with innovations

<p>
  Voice assistants are steadily conquering the hearts of technology users worldwide, and they comprise a significant share of the digital market. Your users would be much more likely to install and keep using your app if it integrates with their <a href="//www.microsoft.com/en-us/cortana" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Cortana</a>, <a href="//www.apple.com/siri/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Siri</a>, <a href="//assistant.google.com/intl/en_uk/#?modal_active=none" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Google Assistant</a>, or <a href="//www.amazon.com/Amazon-Echo-And-Alexa-Devices/b?ie=UTF8&node=9818047011" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Alexa</a>. At the same time, any <a href="//keenethics.com/blog/1548151200000-voice-app-development" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">voice app development agency</a> would tell you that voice services are based on chatbot features. Therefore, implementing a business chatbot for higher education and building up a voice technology would help you to keep up with the pace of technological advancements and to inspire customer loyalty.

## To Wrap Up

<p>
  If you are still not convinced that the chatbot for education is a technology worth developing, consider the following statistics: according to <a href="//www.statista.com/statistics/656596/worldwide-chatbot-market/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Statista</a>, in 2016, the chatbot market comprised $190.8 million. However, by 2025, this number is expected to grow to $1.25 billion.
</p>

Therefore, do not miss the opportunity to become a part of this billion dollar market and make the lives of your users easier by developing a higher education chatbot for business.
